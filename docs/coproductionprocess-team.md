# Team management in co-production process

Before using the Collaborative environment, you must first login with your google credentials or create your own credentials at [https://demo.interlink-project.eu/](https://demo.interlink-project.eu/), i.e. the staging server of INTERLINK. Alternatively, you may do this process in your pilot server:
- [MEF pilot's deployment of Collaborative Environment](https://mef.interlink-project.eu/)
- [VARAM pilot's deployment of Collaborative Environment](https://varam.interlink-project.eu/)
- [Zaragoza pilot's deployment of Collaborative Environment](https://zgz.interlink-project.eu/)
**IMPORTANT**: All members of an envisaged team must logged into the platform before they can be added to a team. ![Login required screen](images/dashboard-loginrequired.PNG) ![AAC screen](images/aac-login-window.PNG)

Next, create a team for taking part in a co-production process. In the figure you can see how two members of a team first log in and then they are assigned to the same team. ![Two user sessions](images/team-management-two-users-login.png) ![Creating a team](images/dashboard-team-creation.png) ![Adding a user](images/dashboard-team-creation2.png) ![Team editing window](images/teamview-edit.png)

The main purpose of a team in the Collaborative Environment is to take part in a [co-production process](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-overview.html). Consequently, we need to create a co-production project where the activity to co-create will be managed ![Creating a new co-production project](images/dashboard-createnewcoproductionprocess.png)

In order to **link the created team to the created co-production process**, you must click on "Add new Team" button, and then select the suitable team in the drop-down list of the pop-up window to be assigned to the currently active co-production process. ![Select Team menu option and "Add new Team" button](images/coproduction-team-assignment.png) ![Click on pop-up window's Add team button](images/coproduction-team-assignment2.png)

Notice that you may create new roles and new teams with different rights than the core co-producersâ€™ team. Currently a role applies to all phases, objectives and tasks of a co-production process.
