# Settings a co-production process

Once you have configured a co-production process, you can always update its details by clicking on the **Settings** menu option on the left hand-side menu. Then, click on the PENCIL icon on the top right hand side to start editing the project details. Finally, hit on the button "Save" to save changes or "Cancel" to cancel them. 

The following details can be updated per project:
- Logo of the project
- Name of the project 
- Short description of the project
- Actual organization of the service
- Aim of the project
- Idea of service to be codelivered
- Challenges of the project

As we can see, this section allows for the definition of the purpose of a project, establishing how will be managed and what challenges it will need to solve. Notice the button "Edit coproduction process" to activate modification of coproduction process' metadata fields.

Besides, the co-production process' SETTING VIEW allows for the following actions to be taken over a process:
- Management of administrators of the coproduction process, i.e. process administrators can be deleted or added. Only a user who is an admin of a co-production process can carry out this action.
- Clear coproduction process tree. The co-production tree assigned to a co-production process can be removed by the process administrators. This will force the association of a new co-production tree schema before co-production process activities can be resumed. 
- Delete coproduction process. This action again can only be performed by the admin of a coproduction process. It will result on the removal of the current coproduction process with the associated removal of all its assets. 

Next screenshot shows how highlighted by a red frame appear administrative tasks that coproduction process administrators can be carried out. For all the action button with red background, namely "Clear coproduction process tree", "Remove coproduction process" or "Remove" menu option that pops up when an admin clicks on 3 "."s on the right hand side on administrator, a confirmation of such action is requested from users.
