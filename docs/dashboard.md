**IMPORTANT**. You may use INTERLINK's deployment at [Staging Server](https://demo.interlink-project.eu/), or, alternatively, you may access the Collaborative Environment's Dashboard in your pilot server:

Before using the Collaborative environment, for first time, you must first login with your google credentials or create your own credentials at [https://demo.interlink-project.eu/](https://demo.interlink-project.eu/), i.e. the staging server of INTERLINK. **IMPORTANT**: All members of an envisaged team must logged into the platform before they can be added to a team. ![Login required screen](images/dashboard-loginrequired.PNG) ![AAC screen](images/aac-login-window.PNG)
