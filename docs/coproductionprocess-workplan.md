# Workplan view of a coproduction process

The workplan view offers a temporal visualization of a co-production process, i.e. the period of time in which its tasks span.

You may access the [WORKPLAN view](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-workplan.html) by either clicking on the "Time planification" link in the [GUIDE view](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-guide.html) of a task or clicking on the left hand side menu option named "Workplan". 

You may return to the  [GUIDE view](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-guide.html), to see the task details by clicking on the name of the task in the [WORKPLAN view](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-workplan.html).

Remember that you assign durations to tasks, by editing a task in [GUIDE view](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-guide.html):
