# Overview of a co-production process

The Overview view is one of the five co-production process visualizations available, namely [Overview](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-overview.html#), [Guide](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-guide.html), [Workplan](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-workplan.html), [Team](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-team.html) and [Settings](/docs/en/coproductionprocess-settings.html) views.  

The Overview view is in charge of showing the ongoing activity on a given co-production process. Inside you can find two sections, the first is progress and the second is resources. 
The progress view display several activities require to setup a co-production project. Each one allows us to access directly to the section where the activity takes place. The list of activities are:
- Set coproduction process data
- (Optional) Set coproduction process administrators
- Select the coproduction schema
- Grant permissions over process to co-producer teams and start co-producing through Guide view
- (Optional) Add new resources to the coproduction process
